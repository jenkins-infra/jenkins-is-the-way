  title: Jenkins & CI/CD keeping project information and code safe while in a private dev environment.
  paragraphs:
    - '**Background:** Before this solution, the DevOps team at IBM in Mexico had to build our packager manually. This took too much time: more than six hours for each face of the compilation process. Additionally, an expert developer must constantly monitor the process in case of a failure. We created a job for each build face in Jenkins and it simplified and saved us a lot of time in the build process, also helped us to detect some failures that we weren''t aware of. **Goals:** Save developer time by creating a better CI/CD process. **Solution & Results:** Jenkins helped us to split our challenge into phases and separate jobs. We had jobs for new releases and daily builds for CI/CD. This way, the developer can do a better job, and work faster. By creating a job for each build in Jenkins, the whole process was simplified. It saved us a lot of time in the build process. It also helped us to detect some failures that we weren''t aware of. As this is a project in a private environment, security plugins have been the most important capabilities we have used. It''s really important to keep our info and code safe. Results we saw from integrating Jenkins include:'
    - |-
      *   build time is 200% faster
      *   improved product performance
      *   test cycles are 100% faster
      *   accelerated release delivery
