  title: Framework experimentation led a legal startup to choose Jenkins.
  paragraphs:
    - "**Background:** Our document generation service started as a pet-project,
      and it was anticipated to transform it into a startup. In moving through
      the transition stages, we sought to save as much capital as possible.
      Simultaneously, we also needed a lightweight CI system that could be used
      by developers and non-experienced staffers alike."
    - "**Goals:** Develop a pipeline for running tests and building
      applications."
    - "**Solution & Results:**"
    - We wanted to experiment with different UI frameworks and to choose one
      that was most suitable for us. After creating a proof of concept, we spent
      a lot of time increasing performance and cleaning the codebase. This
      produced a large set of jobs starting with execution and integration to
      monitoring performance and conducting e2e tests on each branch before
      merging.
    - Not all of our team members had experience with OPS and testing, so we
      needed plugins for custom reporting of each test we would run. For the
      demo purposes, we created jobs for each potential customer configured by
      scripts.
    - We're very impressed with Jenkins, and not just because it is free. We
      love the Pipeline plugin, and Stage View which helped us to improve the
      visualization of the pipeline. GitHub Branch Source was used to make our
      work with GitHub more efficient, and as we say, comfortable. Finally, we
      found Allure to be an excellent tool for analyzing test runs.
    - "The four most significant results are as follows:"
    - >-
      *   we saved money

      *   we set up Jenkins to be suitable for non-experience team members, using a large set of plugins

      *   we created jobs for each potential customer with custom scripts for configuration

      *   we configured pipelines for all kinds of testing
