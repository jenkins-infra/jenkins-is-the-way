  title: Creating a self-service portal allows developers at a digital agency to
    automate services in just a few clicks.
  paragraphs:
    - "**Background:** As a global full-service digital consultancy, we were
      looking to improve the developer and end-to-end life cycle of our website
      development and hosting platforms, driving a request portal with Jenkins
      as the backend automation between all platforms and toolsets"
    - "**Goals:** To unify development and hosting automation across the
      company."
    - "**Solution & Results:** Using Jenkins as the automation engine we have
      been able to create a self-service portal, allowing developers to request
      GKE clusters in any region around the world and then deploy their
      application to it with a few clicks."
    - "We are integrating with a range of tools and Jenkins gives us the
      flexibility to communicate with them all easily:"
    - |-
      *   Jira for our governance
      *   Bitbucket for source code management
      *   Google Cloud as our core platform
    - Although not tested under load as of yet, we do not envisage any
      scalability issues due to the deployment architecture of the Jenkins
      engine and the compute nodes. The key capabilities we relied on were
      varied and included integrations between the Atlassian toolsets, Slack,
      and Kubernetes running on GKE with scalable worker node architecture.
    - "As for results, they included:"
    - |-
      *   the ability to integrate with many platforms
      *   a single place for task automation
      *   audibility of tasks driven through log data for governance
      *   easy to measure metrics for future improvement targets

    content: Jenkins rocks because of the number of available plugins and the
      community support. I have been using Jenkins daily for over 5 years and
      cannot see another tool on the market that would provide this level of
      functionality and flexibility.
