  title: Creating new pipelines from those in use, the dev cycle at this fashion
    e-commerce site is now 10 times faster.
  paragraphs:
    - "**Background:** Modanisa.com launched in 2011 and is the first Turkish
      fashion platform to deliver online clothes shopping to our target audience
      with a lot of variety. Born in Istanbul, we now have customers in 140
      countries. We offer content in 6 languages: Turkish, Arabic, English,
      French, German, and Bahasa. We sell over 650 brands and 70 thousand
      products, shipping thousands of packages a day to five continents. We are
      the co-creator of the Modest Fashion Week concept, which made its debut in
      Istanbul in 2016."
    - "**Goals:** Our goal is to improve our online ordering and multi warehouse
      processes and create a better e-commerce experience."
    - "**Solution & Results:** Jenkins helps us with Multi-branch pipelines and
      declarative pipelines which really did solve our complex challenges. Every
      developer can create his project with a specific branch and deploy it to
      the specific domain which is its own. The key capabilities we relied on
      were Multi-Branch Pipelines, Declarative Pipelines, and RBAC."
    - "The results are typical of many other Jenkins installations:"
    - >-
      *   Our development release cycle is 10x faster

      *   Generally, all deployments have been shortened from 1 day to 10 minutes

      *   When we have a new service and pipeline, we can easily duplicate and create a new one by using an older one as a standard
