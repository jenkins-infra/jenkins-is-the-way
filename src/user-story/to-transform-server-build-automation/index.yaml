  title: Building and managing multiple environments at the same time with the
    flexibility of Jenkins' build logic.
  paragraphs:
    - "**Background:** I needed to develop a reliable and easy to maintain
      software development pipeline to allow for the constant building of
      production environment configurations and more efficient testing."
    - "**Goals:** Simple. We were looking to automate software production and
      the string creation process."
    - "**Solution & Results:** Jenkins pipelines allowed us to automate the
      various individual steps of our software development process and combine
      them all within the pipeline. With Jenkins' build logic, we were able to
      build multiple environments at the same time which, eventually, allowed us
      to build, deploy and test without much manual intervention. Our developers
      could focus on the part of the job they like best - innovating - rather
      than the maintenance of the pipe."
    - "After developing pipelines that we were satisfied with, we found that:"
    - |-
      *   builds are 4x faster
      *   we are able to get constant checks of the baseline
      *   we have the ability to have the status for each step in the pipeline
