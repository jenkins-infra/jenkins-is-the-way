  title: Creating a multi-tenant platform with a smooth CI/CD experience.
  paragraphs:
    - "**Background:** Our services are developed with multi-tenancy in mind,
      meaning that a single instance of the software and its supporting
      infrastructure serves multiple users. Each user shares the software
      application and shares a single database, and each tenant's data is
      isolated and remains invisible to other tenants. More than anything, we
      needed to have a multi-tenant platform with a smooth CI/CD experience that
      would be easy to maintain and change. We also had to consider that many of
      our developers came from a Bamboo-based CI server experience used to
      automate release management."
    - "**Goals:** More specifically, we needed an easy way to get Java-based
      services deployed on Kubernetes."
    - "**Solution & Results:** LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol)
      integration allowed us to get groups from there and map those with Jenkins
      permissions. A common and shared continuous delivery pipeline then helped
      immensely by enabling teams to reuse most CI/CD logics and not write
      everything from scratch."
    - "By using Jenkins and Groovy pipelines, we had the following experiences:"
    - |-
      *   quicker development cycles
      *   smooth onboarding and easy maintenance
      *   a familiar experience for developers coming from Bamboo
