  title: Jenkins pipelines help improve railway signaling performance and empower
    developers with better DevOps processes.
  paragraphs:
    - "**Background:** For our railway software, we needed to improve the
      quality, stability and delivery time of a legacy project, while giving our
      team a way of working smarter and faster."
    - "**Goals:** Monitoring and operation of embedded railway traffic
      management systems."
    - "**Solution & Results:** We migrated almost all components from a
      Subversion repository where, most of the time, people are working on a
      trunk branch to a Bitbucket Repository and Jenkins Pipeline."
    - Now every change is a node on a dedicated branch and merged after a
      reviewed pull request and successful Jenkins build.
    - "We achieved superior results with Jenkins Pipelines, including:"
    - |-
      *   Fewer failed unit tests
      *   Improved code quality, by doing code reviews for every pull request
      *   Increased transparency and awareness of code changes
      *   Easier testing
      *   Build stability; Our master build is now much more stable
