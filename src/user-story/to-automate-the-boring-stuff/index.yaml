  title: Software delivery acceleration with an end-to-end CI/CD pipeline using
    Jenkins
  paragraphs:
    - "**Background:** As a cloud engineer for a technology-centric company that
      focuses on helping clients realize their Asia-Pacific digital needs, fast
      software delivery isn't just a \"nice to have,\" it's a \"must-have.\""
    - Before we used Jenkins for automating the unit testing, security scanning,
      and user acceptance testing (UAT), our developers had to do all the tests
      manually. This is unacceptable as these processes are not just tedious,
      they also slow down our developer workflow. Using Jenkins, we manage to
      create a new workflow for our developers, making the code faster and of
      higher quality than ever before.
    - "**Goals:** Automating all tests for better software quality."
    - "**Solution & Results:**"
    - We chose to use Jenkins to automate the unit testing using PHP-unit. In
      doing so, our developers no longer need to do unit testing manually on
      their local machines. We also have incorporated Sonarqube scanning for
      auditing the developer's code. This helps the developer team identify any
      bugs or vulnerabilities early, before deploying code to the production
      environment.
    - Lastly, we automated the UAT by incorporating Robot-Framework in the
      pipeline. Robot-Framework replicates an actual user by checking the web UI
      according to the unique Robot script created.
    - "We have incorporated several essential Jenkins plugins for this project:"
    - |-
      1.  Gitlab plugin
      2.  Folders Plugin (Organization)
      3.  Git plugin
      4.  Pipeline plugin
      5.  Sonarqube Scanner for Jenkins
    - "Jenkins has helped our team create a complete CI/CD pipeline and, in
      doing so, made our software delivery three times faster than ever! We are
      delighted with the results:"
    - |-
      *   Developer's efficiency increased by 70%
      *   Code smell and bugs managed to be detected early
      *   Releases cycles shortened from 3 days to 3 hours
