  title: From common challenge to clear solution, Jenkins helped Roche standardize
    multidisciplinary team procedures.
  paragraphs:
    - "**Background:** Many cancer care teams face challenges in preparing and
      conducting tumor boards. Without the support of a digital platform, tumor
      boards can be labor intensive and add additional administrative burden.
      Navigating among multiple systems, meeting participants can lose time and
      focus from achieving consensus on patient treatments. We were looking for
      a solution that would help us build and deploy, with infrastructure and
      testing automation."
    - "**Goals:** We were looking to build an application that augments relevant
      medical data into a 360Â° record to support treatment decisions."
    - "**Solution & Results:** Once collected, data is curated and hosted on an
      intuitive dashboard designed to promote collaboration during tumor boards.
      NAVIFY Tumor Board is now a cloud-based workflow product that securely
      integrates and displays relevant aggregated data into a single, holistic
      patient dashboard."
    - "Jenkins - and various plugins like Build Pipeline, Cobertura, Email
      Extension, Performance, and NodeLabel Parameter - helped us facilitate and
      automate a system that now effectively provides:"
    - |-
      *   the introduction of a patient case
      *   input by each specialist using preselected images and reports
      *   treatment discussion including results from other apps
      *   review the latest treatment best practices and record patient pathways
      *   document decisions in the patient record
      *   send decisions to EMR
    - "Our results include:"
    - |-
      *   customer satisfaction
      *   more product usage
      *   continuous feedback
