  title: The configuration of pipeline-as-code with Jenkins reduced upgrades from
    2 days to 2 hours.
  paragraphs:
    - "**Background:** Our team needed to have enough flexibility to be able to
      write everything in code. We also needed to have IDE support and to test
      the solution as a project. More importantly, we sought to make use of the
      entire existing ecosystem already built around Jenkins."
    - "**Goals:** Providing pipelines for everybody without the need to code."
    - "**Solution & Results:** In addition to Jenkins Pipelines, we turned to
      Matrix Authorization Plugin, Kubernetes Plugin, and Gradle for our key
      capabilities. Our solution was an A-Grade project with lots of abstraction
      and tight integration with our infrastructure provider. In doing so, we
      were able to automatically test the pipeline code with a minimal amount of
      clicks."
    - "We achieved superior results with Jenkins Pipelines, including:"
    - >-
      *   Onboarding of teams 100x faster

      *   Confidence in pipeline code increased to 99%

      *   Upgrades that take less than 2 hours compared to 2 days of downtime before
