  title: Becoming an engineer on the heels of a Jenkins test-bed.
  paragraphs:
    - "**Background:** An engineering student built a CI solution using Jenkins
      while attending a public engineering institution in India. The project was
      inspired by a blog post she read on the creation of a versatile Jenkins
      CLI, or command-line interface. Since Garima was the only developer on
      this small project, she chose to build a CI job based on the hypotheses
      that the build was indeed reasonable and that the testing strategy would
      be reusable."
    - "**Goal:** Create a single pipeline that orchestrates the submission of
      hundreds of build jobs."
    - "**Solution & Results:** The solution I built was just a test case I made
      to dive into everything Jenkins. It was a Python Script to implement basic
      Jenkins features without any external libraries. I started by
      investigating Jenkins API and HTTP Protocols and HTTP RFCs. My next step
      was to learn Curl Commands from which I made my starter project. It has
      two scripts: the first having all the functions and the second one with
      UnitTest Cases for each function in the first file."
    - I like Jenkins because of its user-friendly CLI and because there are no
      external dependencies for implementing the basic features of Jenkins. As
      the application grows, I will already have a CI in place to assist
      additional development efforts along the way. Also, I will know early on
      if anyone pushes a failed build or test to my project at a later stage.
      All of the features I've explored truly make Jenkins rock and, for newbies
      like me, it's definitely a must-try for all.
    - "By using Jenkins, I was able to:"
    - |-
      *   create a CI without any external dependencies
      *   ensure a reliable test-bed for future builds and releases
      *   get a great grade on my engineering assignment
