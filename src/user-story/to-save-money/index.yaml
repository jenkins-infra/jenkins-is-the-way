  title: Reducing infrastructure costs and accelerating pipeline delivery by
    nearly half.
  paragraphs:
    - "**Background:** This development and engineering team was tasked with
      enhancing the Continuous Deployment solution for the Brazilian division of
      an international online retailer. For this, they sought to create a unique
      pipeline to support all stages. Their primary challenge in doing so was
      the need to use conditionals."
    - "**Goals:** Reduce costs with infrastructure by using dynamic agents for
      the Continuous Deployment process."
    - "**Solution & Results:** To achieve our goals, we introduced a Jenkins
      Declarative Pipeline using EC2 Dynamic Instances combined with Blue Ocean.
      We were able to spin up agents just when needed, which was vital for this
      endeavor."
    - Using a multi-branch project and the right conditionals on Pipeline, we
      discovered that we could reduce the build times by up to 60%. We also were
      able to reduce costs by using spot instances by up to 40%. The new
      pipeline provided the capability to build and deploy the artifact to our
      specific environment.
    - "Jenkins rocks because it is a customizable, robust solution, and it
      yielded great results:"
    - >-
      *   reduced the pipeline time by 50% including the deployment process

      *   reduced resource costs by 40%

      *   provided pipeline visualization – using Blue Ocean – which was helpful for developers
