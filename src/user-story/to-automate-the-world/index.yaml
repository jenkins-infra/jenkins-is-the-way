    realtime using CI/CD & Jenkins.
  paragraphs:
    - "**Background:** For this deployment, we have multiple back offices to
      manage, with various versions of the framework and various deploy details.
      So each plan of deployment is unique."
    - "**Goals:** The main goal here is to decrease the time it takes to deploy
      new features in our software."
    - "**Solution & Results:** The first step was to make each deploy job. Like
      this, each job can be deployed one by one. Afterward, we create a pipeline
      to run the plan in parallel. After we create the first deploy pipeline, we
      create a second to deploy to a different back office. And finally, we
      create a pipeline to run the other pipeline. Just like that, we create a
      deployment train in inception mode."
    - "We used key capabilities like pipelines, Docker plugins, and Jenkins
      agents to get the following results:"
    - |-
      *   Time to deploy reduced from three hours to just 50 minutes
      *   Overall, fewer mistakes and less human error
      *   Just one step to a CD deployment

quotes:
  - from: Sebastien Sirtoli, DevOps Engineer
    content: Personally I analyze a lot, a lot, a lot of CI/CD tools, and Jenkins is
      the most complete -- by the community and by stability. I love the
      possibility to create everything as code. Code is the way!
