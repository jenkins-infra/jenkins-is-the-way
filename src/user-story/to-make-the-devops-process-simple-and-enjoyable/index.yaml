  title: Bringing better EV charging stations to North America, Europe and Australia.
  paragraphs:
    - "**Background:** Our process for deploying software has always been
      manual. Using Jenkins, we solved the problem of deployments by making
      weekly release cycles and code builds without any manual efforts."
    - "**Goals:** Our goal was to provide the best electric vehicle charging
      experience to customers globally via a new form of charging station."
    - "**Solution & Results:** Now whenever we want to automate some stuff on
      the server, we use Jenkins. Our developers can just create a simple
      Jenkins job and specify all commands in the execute shell and they are all
      set to go. There is no need to enter into the server and do it manually.
      Since we release code every week, Jenkins has made this infinitely more
      possible by removing all manual efforts and saving employee hours. Using
      Jenkins, we can create new infrastructure automatically."
    - As for key capabilities, it feels limitless. The best thing about Jenkins
      is that you can think of any problem and Jenkins already has a plugin
      ready for that. We use multiple Jenkins plugins like GIT, Mail Watcher,
      Maven, and many more.
    - "The results are typical of many other Jenkins installations:"
    - |-
      *   build code faster and without any manual efforts
      *   saved employee hours so that they can contribute to other things
      *   automate the stuff needed to perform on servers
      *   improved product quality
      *   early tracking of bugs
