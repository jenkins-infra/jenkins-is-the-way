  title: Introducing continuous integration to accelerate innovation and
    time-to-market of products and services for the industrial world.
  paragraphs:
    - "**Background:** My company, AKKA I\\&S, provides engineering and
      technology consulting services to customers worldwide. We offer research
      and development, project management, documentation, technical
      infrastructure, studies, information systems, logistics, analysis,
      diagnostics, and operational support. For this particular client, we
      needed continuous integration to deliver our product faster and integrate
      it into the company's main software. It is the first time we have ever
      used CI."
    - "**Goals:** To automatically segment and labelize life science images."
    - '"Jenkins is a powerful tool with a fancy interface! It really accelerates
      your integration."  Thomas Goigoux, Software Engineer, AKKA I\&S'
    - "**Solution & Results:** To faster integrate we used Jenkins CI instead of
      a programmed build-per-day. This solution allows us to gain an important
      amount of time. We build and test each time modifications are pushed on
      our GitLab, and the QA has direct access to the last built branch to test.
      The UI of Jenkins is very clear and easy to use."
    - "There is so much more we will use with Jenkins, but for this initial
      program our results are probably typical for early Jenkins installations:"
    - >-
      *   automatized builds on every committed branch instead of one of all day
      branches

      *   cycles (Dev-Review-QA) are shortened from 1-2 days to few hours

      *   the first step to CI in our company
