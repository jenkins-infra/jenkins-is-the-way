  title: K8s Plugins for Jenkins dynamic workers lead to zero downtime in business
    hours.
  paragraphs:
    - "**Background:** The principal implementation challenge was the creation
      of a CI environment to allow dynamic workers in Jenkins. The K8s plugins
      for Jenkins were the greatest ally. In addition, dynamic workers show the
      responsibility to use the right values for memory and CPU requests in the
      K8s cluster managed by Jenkins Master. We got measures from distinct pod
      types to choose the request values."
    - "**Goals:** Reduce the time to market. Agility in software development."
    - "**Solution & Results:** The solution was the monitorization over Jenkins
      master and Jenkins dynamic workers. The request values ( CPU and memory)
      in our K8s cluster are based on pod type by technology, build tools, and
      business platform. This solution provides the efficient use of the K8s
      cluster."
    - "Key capabilities include:"
    - |-
      *   K8s Plugins for Jenkins dynamic workers
      *   Plugin for exposing monitoring endpoints such as a Prometheus plugin
      *   Bitbucket multibranch plugin for use or SCM
      *   In addition, the best feature of Jenkins is the worldwide community
    - "We are happy with the results:"
    - |-
      *   Dynamic workers
      *   Request values by pod type in k8s cluster
      *   Infrastructure as a code using helm chart official
      *   Zero downtime in business hours
      *   Faster upgrades
