  title: Jenkins' rich plugin architecture supports an enhanced CI/CD and
    development ease.
  paragraphs:
    - "**Background:** For this retail giant, the main challenge was limited
      CI/CD options available for the project and the complexity and diversity
      of tasks that would need to be automated."
    - "**Goal:** Integrate old and new product management systems."
    - "**Solution & Results:**"
    - The flexibility offered by Jenkins allowed us to create custom pipelines
      for all of our needs in the project, from building a Python application as
      a Docker image to the automation of the Kubernetes clusters creation,
      deletion, and updates.
    - We leveraged Jenkins' ability to run jobs in Kubernetes clusters
      dynamically and used Kubernetes secrets as credentials for Jenkins jobs.
      JCasC allowed us to declaratively source both of the pipelines and
      configure plugins and other aspects of the Jenkins deployments.
    - As we used Flux CD, we automated Jenkins upgrades to keep it updated
      automatically. There were challenges with the approach of making changes
      in the plugin ecosystem, but it was fairly easy to resolve.
    - "The key capabilities we relied on were:"
    - |-
      *   Pipelines running in Kubernetes pods
      *   Kubernetes secrets used as Jenkins credentials
      *   JCasC
      *   Scripted Jenkinsfile as pipeline definitions
      *   Parallel run of some tasks
      *   OSS helm chart to deploy and manage Jenkins in Flux GitOps setup
      *   Ability to self-host CI/CD automation tool
    - "Jenkins helped us:"
    - >-
      *   Run very diverse tasks

      *   Simplify configuration and updates via IaC and GitOps

      *   Experience faster delivery by sharing code between multiple teams thanks to Jenkins JCasC and IaC
