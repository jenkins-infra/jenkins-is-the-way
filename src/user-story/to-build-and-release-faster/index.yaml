  title: Automating the boring stuff made releases 5X faster.
  paragraphs:
    - "**Background:** Our software developers' main challenge is the slowdown
      that comes with quality checks and getting stakeholder approvals without
      coming to a full halt. We wanted to automatically run the software
      development process at a specific time. At various intervals in the
      process, we have the work go through QE and the SMEs' approval."
    - "**Goals:** Quicker and higher-quality delivery of enterprise software to
      enterprise customers and the open-source community."
    - "**Solution & Results:** Jenkins offered excellent support with its
      considerable number of plugins and the ease of building and developing
      pipelines. We have solved many of the problems and overcame many of the
      challenges by understanding the platform. We were able to customize as
      required using libraries that we have written using Groovy."
    - To make things easier for this particular project, we relied on a few
      choice plugins. These include the Gerrit plugin, the AWS EC2 plugin, the
      Openshift plugin, and the Thin backup plugin.
    - "We were pleased to see the following results:"
    - >-
      *   releases were 5x faster

      *   automated error reporting and customization helped us save time with each release

      *   ability to focus on important things because we were able to automate the boring stuff by almost 99%
